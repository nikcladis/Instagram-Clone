# 📝 Process

I started by highlighting down in my notebook what features I wanted for my social app. I use Instagram a lot so I drew inspiration from that.

I started with the designing part, with the Home Page ("/"), the Authentication Page ("/auth") and Profile Page ("/{username}"), then focused on the Sidebar.

After I set up routing, making the default path to be the authentication page when the user isn't signed up, and setting the Firebase for storing my users credentials. 

Then I started adding features to the user's Profile Page, like editing his profile picture/name/bio, uploading posts.

# 🤔 How Can It Be Improved?

It would be amazing if users were able to receive notifications when someone follows them or likes/comments on posts. Adding testing would be benificial as well, something I definitely plan to do next time.
